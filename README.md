## 🎯 Aim  
To perform the exploration of prompting techniques for **AI-based video generation**, understanding how descriptive text inputs influence visual and motion outcomes.  

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm  
Explore how various prompting techniques can be used to **generate and manipulate video content** — including animations, visual effects, transitions, and summaries — using different **AI video generation models**.

---

## 🧠 Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with Video Generation Models  

Begin by exploring **free or trial-based AI video generation tools**. Each has unique capabilities and creative potential.  

| Tool | Description | Free Access |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| 🧩 **Runway Gen-2** | High-quality text-to-video and image-to-video generation with cinematic realism. | Limited free credits |
| 🧑‍💻 **Synthesia** | Avatar-based videos for tutorials, explainers, or presenters. | Free demo |
| 🎥 **Pictory** | Turns written scripts or articles into narrated videos. | Free trial |
| 🧠 **DeepBrain AI** | Realistic digital humans and AI presenters with speech. | Limited free version |
 

---

## ✍️ Step 2: Start with Simple Prompts  

Start with small, general prompts to understand baseline behavior.  

**Example Prompt:**  
> “A paper boat gently floating on a calm pond.”  

---

## 🎨 Step 3: Add Creative Details  

Enhance realism by adding environmental and emotional details.  

**Example Prompt:**  
>“A paper boat drifting across a lotus-filled pond during golden sunset, with dragonflies hovering and water ripples glowing warmly.”

---

## ⏳ Step 4: Incorporate Time and Motion  

Add movement, transitions, or evolution of time to make the video dynamic.  

**Example Prompt:**  
>“A barren land transforming into a blooming meadow as rain clouds gather, rain falls, and sunshine breaks through the sky.”
---

## 🎬 Step 5: Experiment with Video Styles  

Try generating videos in multiple styles to observe visual diversity.  

| Style | Example Prompt | Possible Output |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| 🎨 **Animation** | “An animated robot travelling through colorful planets, each with unique creatures and landscapes.” | Stylized animated space journey |
| 🎞️ **Cinematic** | “A drone-like cinematic shot of waves crashing against a rocky cliff during sunrise.” | High-detail realistic nature scene|
| 🧚 **Artistic** | “A pastel watercolor-style video showing a fox exploring a glowing enchanted forest.” | Hand-painted artistic motion |
| 🌍 **Documentary** | “A time-lapse showing coral reefs recovering over years as marine life slowly returns.” | Documentary-style environmental realism |

---

## 🔁 Step 6: Iterate and Refine  

Fine-tune prompts to enhance details like lighting, pacing, or camera movement.  

**Before:**  
> “A mountain during snowfall.”
**After Refinement:**  
>“A cinematic slow-motion view of snow falling over a pine-covered mountain at twilight, with moving mist between the trees.” 

---

## 🧪 Step 7: Generate Multiple Versions  

Create slight variations in your prompt to test how wording affects output.

**Example Variations:**

1️⃣ “A frozen lake slowly melting as spring sunlight appears.”
2️⃣ “A dry field turning lush green as monsoon rain begins.”
3️⃣ “A city skyline transitioning from night to sunrise with increasing traffic.”
